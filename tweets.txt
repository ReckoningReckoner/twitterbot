The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.#BellLetsTalk
 All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in histori...#BellLetsTalk
...cal conditions.#BellLetsTalk
 The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favor of bourgeois property.#BellLetsTalk
 The distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property.#BellLetsTalk
But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating...#BellLetsTalk
... products that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.#BellLetsTalk
 In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.#BellLetsTalk
 We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of...#BellLetsTalk
... a man's own labor, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.#BellLetsTalk
 Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form o...#BellLetsTalk
...f property that preceded the bourgeois form?#BellLetsTalk
There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destr...#BellLetsTalk
...oying it daily.#BellLetsTalk
 Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?#BellLetsTalk
 But does wage labor create any property for the laborer?#BellLetsTalk
Not a bit.#BellLetsTalk
It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage labor, and which cannot increase except upon conditions ...#BellLetsTalk
...of begetting a new supply of wage labor for fresh exploitation.#BellLetsTalk
Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor.#BellLetsTalk
Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.#BellLetsTalk
 To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social STATUS in production.#BellLetsTalk
Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united ...#BellLetsTalk
...action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.#BellLetsTalk
 Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.#BellLetsTalk
 When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property ...#BellLetsTalk
...is not thereby transformed into social property.#BellLetsTalk
It is only the social character of the property that is changed.#BellLetsTalk
It loses its class character.#BellLetsTalk
 Let us now take wage labor.#BellLetsTalk
 The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely req...#BellLetsTalk
...uisite to keep the laborer in bare existence as a laborer.#BellLetsTalk
What, therefore, the wage laborer appropriates by means of his labor merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existen...#BellLetsTalk
...ce.#BellLetsTalk
We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labor, an appropriation that is made for the...#BellLetsTalk
... maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labor of others.#BellLetsTalk
All that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the laborer lives merely to i...#BellLetsTalk
...ncrease capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.#BellLetsTalk
 In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to increase accumulated labor.#BellLetsTalk
In communist society, accumulated labor is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the laborer.#BellLetsTalk
 In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in communist society, the present dominates the past.#BellLetsTalk
In bourgeois society, capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individu...#BellLetsTalk
...ality.#BellLetsTalk
 And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so.#BellLetsTalk
The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.#BellLetsTalk
 By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.#BellLetsTalk
 But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also.#BellLetsTalk

 You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner ...#BellLetsTalk

 According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those who acquire ...#BellLetsTalk
...anything, do not work.#BellLetsTalk
The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: There can no longer be any wage labor when there is ...#BellLetsTalk

 When the European workers had again gathered sufficient strength for a new onslaught upon the power of the ruling classes, ...#BellLetsTalk

Its aim was to weld together into one huge army the whole militant working class of Europe and America.#BellLetsTalk
Therefore it could not set out from the principles laid down in the Manifesto.#BellLetsTalk
It was bound to have a programme which would not shut the door on the English trade unions, the French, Belgian, Italian, an...#BellLetsTalk
